# Getting Started

## Get the package

The first thing you need to do, is grab the distribution files on NPM.

**Via yarn:**

```text
yarn add @projectstorm/react-diagrams
```

**Via npm:**

```text
npm install @projectstorm/react-diagrams
```

**Via pnpm:**

```text
pnpm add @projectstorm/react-diagrams
```

When you run this in your project directory, this will install the library into `./node_modules/@projectstorm/react-diagrams`. You will then find a **dist** folder that contains all the minified and production ready code.
