# Simple Usage

Welcome to STORM React Diagrams (SRD). SRD is a no-nonsense easy to use library for creating
flow diagrams in the web that can ultimately represent any type of process/network/graph etc..

<!-- STORY -->

Try moving around one of the nodes or clicking and dragging the links to create new link anchors (points).
You can also zoom the canvas using the mouse wheel / scroll gesture and drag to select multiple entities on the graph by shift + dragging the mouse.
